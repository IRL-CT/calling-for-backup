### Experimental Conditions
- **Interruption Condition (n=30):** Robot interrupts child before they finish answering
- **Control Condition (n=29):** Robot does not interrupt
- **All participants** experienced 3 successive performance errors

### Robot Platform
- **Robot:** Simon (Nodbot) - simple 2-axis robot with speaker
- **Control:** Wizard-of-Oz methodology
- **Recording:** 2 cameras (room view + laptop webcam)

### Protocol
1. Introduction to robot Simon
2. Video visualization task (6 short videos with robots/humans, successes/failures)
3. Pre-interaction robot perception survey (5-point Likert scale)
4. Social error manipulation (interruption or control during Q&A)
5. **Performance error:** 3 successive failures to understand "call the researcher" command
6. Post-interaction robot perception survey
7. Debriefing and deception explanation

**Session duration:** ~7 minutes

## Key Findings

### Similarities with Adult Responses

Like adults (Liu et al., 2025), children demonstrated:

- ✅ **Verbal adaptation:** Modified prompts (repeating, simplifying, adding specificity) and adjusted vocal tone/cadence (slower speech, demanding/interrogative tones)
- 📈 **Emotional progression:** Similar evolution from confusion to frustration across successive errors
- ⏱️ **Response timing:** Increased response latencies and variability with successive failures
- 🚪 **Interaction abandonment:** Some participants completely discontinued interaction by the third error

### Key Differences from Adult Responses

Children exhibited distinct behavioral patterns:

- 🔴 **Greater disengagement:** Children showed notably more disengagement behaviors, often temporarily ignoring the robot
- 🙋 **External help-seeking ("Calling for Backup"):** Unlike adults who attempted self-directed problem-solving, children looked for or called the researcher, demonstrating different agency expectations
- 🙏 **Politeness strategies:** Children more readily shifted to polite language forms ("please") when initial commands failed
- ⚡ **Earlier disengagement:** Children showed disengagement beginning at Error I, while adults primarily abandoned after Error III (n=7)
- 🔄 **Mixed engagement patterns:** Children displayed more dynamic patterns, sometimes disengaging then re-engaging, unlike the more linear adult progression

### Social Error (Interruption)

- **84%** of children (21/25) in the Interruption condition shifted their answer to the new question, **not acknowledging the interruption**
- Only 2 children continued responding to the previous question
- Children appeared oblivious to or unconcerned with interruption as a social violation

### Robot Perception

**No significant changes** in robot perception across any measured dimension:
- Willingness to continue interacting
- Competence
- Trust
- Social acceptance
- Likeability

This suggests children have **more flexible conversational expectations** with robots compared to adults.

### Behavioral Response Patterns

**Most common engagement trajectories** (Error I → Error II → Error III):
1. Engage → Engage → Engage (n=15)
2. Engage → Disengage → Engage (n=5)
3. Engage → Disengage → Disengage (n=4)

**Response categories observed:**
- **Verbal reprompting:** Repeating, more specific/longer prompts, simpler prompts, term swapping
- **Vocal modifications:** Slower speech, demanding tone, interrogative tone, assertive tone, filler words
- **Physical behaviors:** Moving closer to robot, standing up, leaving room
- **Emotional displays:** Confusion, frustration, amusement/humor
- **Disengagement:** Looking for researcher, no prompt, quitting interaction

## Design Implications for Child-Robot Interaction

| Observed Behavior | Design Implication |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Children's perception remained stable despite successive errors | **Design for Error Tolerance:** Focus on managing errors gracefully rather than aggressively eliminating them. Allow minor errors without elaborate apologies. |
| Children frequently call for adult help after repeated failures | **Facilitate External Help-Seeking:** Recognize requests for human assistance as valid and implement graceful handoff mechanisms. |
| Children use sophisticated verbal strategies (repetition, specificity, politeness) | **Implement Multi-Layered Conversational Repair:** Design systems sensitive to prompt reformulation and increase error confidence based on politeness markers. |
| Children exhibit dynamic engagement patterns | **Employ Non-Intrusive Error Recovery:** Recognize disengagement as active problem-solving. Avoid intrusive re-engagement; monitor passively. |
| Response latencies increase with successive errors | **Utilize Timing as Failure Metric:** Integrate response latency analysis as real-time measure of cognitive load and distress. |
