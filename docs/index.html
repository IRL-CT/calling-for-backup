                <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Reactions to successive robot error. After providing instructions to the child,
                the robot fails to understand their prompt three times. In this vignette, participant reacts to failure by
                moving closer to robot and using verbal adaptations (demanding tone, slower cadence). After the third error,
                child exhibits clear signs of frustration and humor, before repeating the command.

        <!-- Abstract -->
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="abstract">
            How do children respond to repeated robot errors? While prior research has examined adult reactions to
            successive robot errors, children's responses remain largely unexplored. In this study, we explore children's
            reactions to robot social errors and performance errors. For the latter, this study reproduces the successive
            robot failure paradigm of Liu et al. with child participants (N=59, ages 8-10) to examine how young users
            respond to repeated robot conversational errors. Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand
            their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed.
        </p>
        <p class="abstract">
            We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study. Like adults,
            children adjusted their prompts, modified their verbal tone, and exhibited increasingly emotional non-verbal
            responses throughout successive errors. However, children demonstrated more disengagement behaviors, including
            temporarily ignoring the robot or actively seeking an adult. Errors did not affect participants' perception of
            the robot, suggesting more flexible conversational expectations in children. These findings inform the design
            of more effective and developmentally appropriate human-robot interaction systems for young users.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Central Question:</strong> How do children perceive and react to repeated robot error?</p>
            <p>This study investigates two dimensions of robot failures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Error:</strong> Inappropriate interruption during conversation</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Error:</strong> Repeated failure to understand user commands (3 successive errors)</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Key Findings -->
        <h2>Key Findings</h2>

        <h3>Similarities with Adult Responses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verbal adaptation:</strong> Both children and adults modified prompts and adjusted vocal tone/cadence</li>
            <li><strong>Emotional progression:</strong> Similar evolution from confusion to frustration across successive errors</li>
            <li><strong>Response timing:</strong> Increased response latencies and variability with successive failures</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction abandonment:</strong> Some participants discontinued interaction by the third error</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Differences from Adult Responses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greater disengagement:</strong> Children showed notably more disengagement behaviors, often temporarily ignoring the robot</li>
            <li><strong>External help-seeking ("Calling for Backup"):</strong> Unlike adults, children looked for or called the researcher, demonstrating different agency expectations</li>
            <li><strong>Politeness strategies:</strong> Children more readily shifted to polite language forms ("please") when initial commands failed</li>
            <li><strong>Earlier disengagement:</strong> Children showed disengagement beginning at Error I, while adults primarily abandoned after Error III</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed engagement patterns:</strong> Children displayed more dynamic patterns, sometimes disengaging then re-engaging</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Perception of Robot</h3>
        <p class="finding-highlight">
            Robot errors <strong>did not change children's perception</strong> of the robot across dimensions of
            willingness to interact, competence, trust, social acceptance, and likeability. This suggests more
            flexible conversational expectations in children compared to adults.
